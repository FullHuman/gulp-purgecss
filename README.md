> [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin to removed unused CSS, using [purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss)

## Regarding Issues

This is just a simple [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin, which means it's nothing more than a thin wrapper around `purgecss`. If it looks like you are having CSS related issues, please go to the [purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss/issues) repo. Only create a new issue if it looks like you're having a problem with the plugin itself.

## Install

```
npm i -D gulp-purgecss
npm install --save-dev gulp-purgecss
